# Playlist Creator

> Simple application that allows users to search songs and create playlists using the Spotify API.  
> *While the app live and public, Spotify API access is limited to 25 spotify accounts (Developer Mode). This is in line with Spotify's policy for smaller projects. Please see [Demo Video](https://youtu.be/s-qnxqcxXOE) for instructions*

## Description

- I was motivated to build this project to further strengthen my knowledge of React, CSS, and API Calls.
- I was inspired to build this project after working on a similar one while doing studying React on Codecademy. I wanted to create my own UI and as well as structure the project differently.
- This time I elected to use functional components instead of class based React components. This provided a nice challenge when approaching state. Which I feel led to me understanding React better as a whole.
- This project allows users to create playlists faster than if they were to use the Spotify App. The workflow focuses on the current playlist you're building which allows for less clicking through menu's when trying to add songs on Spotify.
